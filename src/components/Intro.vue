      <h2>MENTORSHIP PROGRAM</h2>
      <h2>IN MEMORY OF</h2>
      <h2 class="jim-name">JIM WALROD</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Jim Walrod (1961-2017) was an interior designer, curator, writer, and
      fixture of downtown New York. Growing up in New Jersey, he would gaze
      across the river and dream of a life in New York City; after high school
      he moved to the city to fulfil that dream. Despite his lack of a formal
      education, he went on to have a wildly successful career and was known for
      his original style, eclectic taste, and encyclopedic knowledge of
      contemporary design. He was a generous friend to many and was at his
      happiest when connecting people with one anotherâ€”spinning a web of
      meaningful relationships.

    <p>
      We are currently seeking mentors to contribute their expertise to one
      mentee over a six month period. Mentors will need to provide their mentee
      access to their studio or office twice a month throughout the six month
      mentorship period (between February and August 2019) and advise the mentee
      on their proposed project.
